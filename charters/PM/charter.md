# PM (_Program, Product, or Project Management_) Team Charter

## Description

The Data Coordination Platform (DCP) PM team is responsible for the oversight of the DCP *as product*, developing the shared understanding of the overall product vision, priorities, and release schedule with the community.

The core team is composed of *Project Leads* and *Product Owners* from each DCP project, *DCP UX* (Voice of the Customer), and a *Science Program Manager*.

## Definitions

### Project Lead

When a DCP charter is approved, the community explictly delegates authority and leadership for a specific project and its scope to a **Project Lead**. The **Project Lead** is responsible for clearly defining and communicating the long-term vision and direction of the project.

Similar to [Mozilla module owners](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/module-ownership/), **Project Leads** are never *tyrants*. They are chartered to make decisions for their DCP project with input from the community and in the best interests of the community. 

### Product Owner
As adapted from the [Scrum process](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-po), a **Product Owner** manages the [Product Backlog](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog) for their DCP project including:
>* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
>* Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
>* Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
>* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next
>* Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed

**NOTE**: The responsibilities of the **Project Lead** and **Product Owner** are tightly intertwined. At an overly simplistic level, the **Project Lead** is more responsible for strategic objectives while the **Product Owner** drives tactical execution. In actual practice, it is a close partnership when planning and coordinating development with other projects.

### Science Program Manager

The **Science Program Manager** is the formal liaison between HCA Science Leadership and the DCP community.

### Thematic Roadmap
A **Thematic Roadmap** identifies and expresses customer needs as a small collection of themes or strategic objectives which:
* Focuses the DCP community on a documented set of high-level customer priorities
* Excites users about the future of DCP

### Request for Comments

**Request for Comments (RFC)** is the transparent process that manages all significant enhancements to the DCP software technical and governance documentation, both normative and informative

* Act as final arbiter for escalated conflicts from the DCP community

*Communication*
* Coordinate regular outreach and announcements to the DCP community and the HCA Science Leadership

* Primary liaison between the HCA Science Leadership and the DCP community facilitated by the *Science Program Manager*

*Planning*

Strategic 

* Identify and maintain a repository of user personas and stories informed by *DCP UX* research

* Facilitate a planning process on a regular cadence to solicit input from the HCA Science and DCP communities
    * Publish a Thematic Roadmap RFC based on that input that also adddresses strategic technical objectives from the DCP Architecture team

Tactical
